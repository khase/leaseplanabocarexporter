# Requirements

all these examples require the following tools to be available in the executing directory:
- LeaseplanAbocarExporter (https://github.com/khase/LeaseplanAbocarExporter)
- FillTemplate (https://github.com/khase/FillTemplate)

Additionally the `LeaseplanAbocarExporter login` command has to be executed beforehand. 

Even trough the scripts are currently only for linux the required tools both have equivilent windows binaries and can be used under windows as well.
Since the tools are written in golang they can be combiled for a variety of different systems.

## changeSinceLastRun
changeSinceLastRun will generate a simple overview with newly added and just removed cars from the list.

**NOTE**: this script requires a cars.json from a previous export to be present in the current directory.

The output is in a simple Text Format
```
added: 
- Car 1 (url to the car)
- Car 2 (url to the car)
- Car 3 (url to the car)
removed: 
- Car 1 (url to the car - possible 404)
- Car 2 (url to the car - possible 404)
- Car 3 (url to the car - possible 404)
```
