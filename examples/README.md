# Requirements

all these examples require the following tools to be available in the executing directory:
- LeaseplanAbocarExporter (https://github.com/khase/LeaseplanAbocarExporter)
- FillTemplate (https://github.com/khase/FillTemplate)

Additionally the `LeaseplanAbocarExporter login` command has to be executed beforehand. 

Since the tools are written in golang they can be combiled for a variety of different systems.

# Test Setup

The prebuild scripts are build with the following Setup in mind:
- Checkout both Repositories in one folder.
- Copy your platforms binary into its root.
- call the scripts from this folders cli `./LeaseplanAbocarExporter/examples/generateExcel.sh` (works the same under windows with the .ps1 scripts)

```
- /LeaseplanAbocarExporter/.... (the Repository)
- /FillTemplate/.... (this Repository is optional)
- /LeaseplanAbocarExporter (the Binary)
- /FillTemplate (the Binary)
```

# Info

## generateExcel
generateExcel will generate a simple excel file (actually csv) with the following informations

| Name | Marke | Model | PS | BLP | Fahrzeugtyp | Farbe | Farbfamilie | Schaltung | Treibstoff | Antrieb | TÃ¼rAnz | SitzAnz |
|------|-------|-------|----|-----|-------------|-------|-------------|-----------|------------|---------|--------|---------|

## changeSinceLastRun
changeSinceLastRun will generate a simple overview with newly added and just removed cars from the list.

**NOTE**: this script requires a cars.json from a previous export to be present in the current directory.

The output is in a simple Text Format
```
added: 
- Car 1 (url to the car)
- Car 2 (url to the car)
- Car 3 (url to the car)
removed: 
- Car 1 (url to the car - possible 404)
- Car 2 (url to the car - possible 404)
- Car 3 (url to the car - possible 404)
```
